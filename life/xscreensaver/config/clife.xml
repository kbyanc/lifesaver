  <_description>
Colorized version of Conway's game of life.  Follows standard rules in
which new cells are born when there are exactly 3 neighbors; the color
of the new cell is the average of the 3 neighbors plus some small random offset.
Existing cells survive if there are 2 or 3 neighbors, otherwise they die.
Written by Kelly Yancey.
